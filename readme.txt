Adds a UK postcode lookup tool into WooCommerce's checkout process.

== Description ==
This plugin enables your customers to complete their billing/shipping addresses by entering their postcode and selecting their address from the options given.

It utilises getAddress.io (https://getaddress.io) to do the lookup using their Royal Mail Postcode Address File.

An API key is required for the integration to work, and the integration only appears when the customer has selected United Kingdom (or, more specifically, the ISO-3166-2 code "GB") for their country.

It can optionally be turned off for the shipping or billing addresses, and can be enabled or disabled in each of the checkout, customer account and WooCommerce admin screens.

Postcodes that are looked up are saved in a custom database table for 24 hours to help reduce your costs for use of the getAddress.io API.

== Requirements ==

[WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com), at least version 3.0.
[getAddress.io API Key](https://getaddress.io). A number of pricing plans are available.

== Installation ==

Install via the WordPress Plugin Directory, or download a release from this repository and install as you would a normal WordPress plugin.

== Usage ==

Once installed and activated, you need to go to the WooCommerce -> Settings -> General page in the WordPress dashboard. You can enter your API key and set your other options here.

== Conflicts with other plugins ==

Certain plugins that also modify checkout fields can conflict with this plugin and prevent it from working.

Usually, the symptom of this is that the "Find Address" button does not appear.

Since version 2.1, I've added a Hook Priority setting at the bottom of the settings for the plugin that you can use to try and fix these conflicts.

The default priority is 10, but using a higher number makes my plugin modify the checkout later in the process - you will probably need to experiment to find the priority that makes my plugin's changes happen after the conflicting plugin.

For example, a priority of 1001 seems to fix conflicts with the "Checkout Field Editor" plugin by ThemeHigh.

== Filter Reference ==

For developers, I've included a few filters that you can use to customise certain aspects of the plugin. These are:

= User Interface =

All of these filters take one argument, `$text`.

`gazchaps-woocommerce-getaddress-io_find-address-button-text` - the text shown on the Find Address buttons (default: Find Address)
`gazchaps-woocommerce-getaddress-io_find-address-searching-text` - the text shown when the Find Address button is selected (default: Searching...)
`gazchaps-woocommerce-getaddress-io_enter-address-manually-text` - the text shown for the "Enter an address manually" link (default: Enter an address manually)

Note: Although these two texts are translatable, filters will override any translations.

= Error Messages =

All of these filters take one argument, `$message`, the error message that will be displayed to the user.

`gazchaps-woocommerce-getaddress-io_api_error_400` - shown when the postcode supplied is invalid/empty
`gazchaps-woocommerce-getaddress-io_api_error_401` - shown when the API key provided in the settings is invalid
`gazchaps-woocommerce-getaddress-io_api_error_404` - shown when no addresses were found for the supplied postcode
`gazchaps-woocommerce-getaddress-io_api_error_429` - shown when the API key has hit its usage limit
`gazchaps-woocommerce-getaddress-io_api_error_500` - shown when there is a server error at getAddress.io

Note: By default, the error messages are "customer friendly", i.e. they don't go into much detail about the cause of the error!

= Styling =

`gazchaps-woocommerce-getaddress-io_billing_selector_row_class` - changes the CSS class on the form-row that the billing address selector is placed into
`gazchaps-woocommerce-getaddress-io_shipping_selector_row_class` - changes the CSS class on the form-row that the shipping address selector is placed into
`gazchaps-woocommerce-getaddress-io_clear_additional_fields` - defaults to true, set to '__return_false' to stop the "additional fields" area of the checkout having a clear style applied to it

* Declared compatibility with WooCommerce High Performance Order Storage -- thanks benatherton for the information.

= 2.2 (10/02/2022) =

* Stopped using <script> elements to output the Find Address buttons, as this was causing issues with some other checkout-modification plugins like Fluid Checkout.

* Fixed a bug with the new hide address fields option not functioning correctly when GB is the only country available to select. Thanks again to prodograw.

= 2.0.2 (10/06/2021) =

* Removed some duplicate JS that had crept in

= 2.0.1 (09/06/2021) =

* Somehow the push I did to the WordPress plugin repo missed some files - hopefully this will fix it...

* Added settings in WC admin panel to change the text shown on the Find Address button, and the text shown in the new "Searching..." state
* Added filters for the above texts for developer control
* The JavaScript file is now only enqueued when on the checkout or account pages, which should speed up performance of other pages.

= 1.4 (12/06/2020) =

* Uses the postcode returned by getAddress.io to "tidy up" the postcode field after the lookup is completed. Thanks to bootle for the suggestion.

= 1.3 (06/05/2020) =
